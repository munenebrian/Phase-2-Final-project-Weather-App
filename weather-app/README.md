# Weather App
# Author : Brian Munene
This is my phase 2 (React) final project. A weather app that intergrates external API (opemweathermap) to fetch data on weather for different cities all across the globe.
The application changes its background according to the city's temperature. It also displays the wind speed, humidity, cloud status, just to mention a few.
Hope as you interact with my application you will have as much fun as i did making it. || React, has reacted well :) ||
